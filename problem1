#You have list of integers.The problem is to return a list where each index has a vlue equal to the product of the remaining integrs in the list.
list1 = [1,2,3,4]
#desired output is [24, 12, 8, 6]
list2 = []
n = len(list1)
#use 2 loops to traverse the list1
for i in range(n):
    result = 1
    for j in range(n):

        if j==i:
            continue
        else:
            result = result*list1[j]


    list2.append(result)
print list2
